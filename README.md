# EIC-TwinPeaksPie

This repository is dedicated to the electron-pion rejection analysis for the EIC experiment.

-CalData is an adaptation of AnaTutorial ( https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/tutorials/tree/master/AnaTutorial) created to save the root files with the EMCal and HCal information.

-CalData works with the macros located at the repository https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/macros.

-Matching finds the closest cluster to a given track and the closest tower to a given cluster. Besides, it plots the coefficient of the deposited energy by the track momentum.

-Pieefficiency plots the coefficient of Energy/momentum distributions of both electrons and pions and efficiency distributions.
